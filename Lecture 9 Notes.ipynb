    "## Public Key Cryptography\n",
    "\n",
    "### Public Key Blueprint\n",
    "\n",
    "The keys that are used to encrypt and decrypt are different. \n",
    "* Anyone who wants to be a receiver needs to *publish* a key (public key).\n",
    "* Anyone who wants to be a receiver needs a unique decryption key (private key).\n",
    "\n",
    "It should not be possible to extract plaintext with the cipher text and public key. A private key must be presented to decrypt the cipher text.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important question**:<br>\n",
    "Do public key cipher systems solve all the problems of symmetric key cipher systems?<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**The answer is NO**. There are still issues faced in symmetric key cipher systems. For example, key exchange problems or trust issues when authenticating etc.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### One-Way Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "They are **easy to implement** and **difficult to reverse.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**OWFs:**\n",
    "1. *Multiplying two primes*:<br>\n",
    "    It is believed to be a one-way function. The reason we say \"believed\" is that no one has been able to prove that it is hard to factorise. If someone one day does find an efficient way of factorising, then it would cause major problems for encryption algorithms using this technique.\n",
    "2. *Modular exponentiation*:<br>\n",
    "    Exponentiation is described as raising a to the power of b. In other words, it is multiplying **a** by itself **b** times. Modular exponentiation is computing:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        a^b mod n\n",
    "        \n",
    "    It is again **easy to implement** but **hard to crack**.\n",
    "3. Modular square roots\n",
    "    (square root of a number) modulo some other number\n",
    "\n",
    "### ElGamal\n",
    "\n",
    "* Let *p* be a large prime.\n",
    "* Select number *g*, which must be a primitive element modulo *p*.\n",
    "* Select a private key x, which can be any number bigger than *1* and smaller than *p-1*\n",
    "* Compute public key y from x, p and g\n",
    "        y = g^x mod p\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**ElGamal Example**:<br>\n",
    "*Encryption*:<br>\n",
    "Let *p* = 23, primitive *g* = 11, private key *x* = 6\n",
    "\n",
    "    11^6 (mod 23)\n",
    "    = 9\n",
    "\n",
    "Public key is 9<br>\n",
    "Private key is 6<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ciphers generated C_1 = g^k mod p and C_2 = M x y^k mod p<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Encrypt M = 10 using public key 9\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generate random number k = 3\n",
    "2. Compute \n",
    "\n",
    "        C_1 = 11^3 mod 23 = 20\n",
    "        C_2 = 10 x 9^3 mod 23 = 22\n",
    "        C = (20, 22)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Decryption*:<br>\n",
    "1. The receiver use their private key x to transform C_1\n",
    "        \n",
    "        C_1^x = (g^k)^x mod p\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Then, divide this number by C_2 to get M.\n",
    "\n",
    "        20^6 = 16 mod 23\n",
    "        22 / 16 = 10 mod 23\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Plaintext = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pros and Cons of ElGamal\n",
    "\n",
    "ElGamal does not rely on factorisation being hard whereas it requires a random number generator and applies message expansion.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Diffie-Helman\n",
    "\n",
    "Diffie-Helman is **not** an encryption algorithm. It is rather a key exchange method. It helps us exchange public (non-secret) information to obtain a shared secret.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**What makes it useful?**:<br>\n",
    "* Resulting shared secret cannot be computed without the cooperation of both parties.\n",
    "* A third party cannot deduce the shared secret.\n",
    "\n",
    "DH Key Exchange assumes that:\n",
    "1. There is a public key cipher system\n",
    "2. There is a public function which takes two parameters F(x,y) and returns a third number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diffie-Helman key exchange most commonly use ElGamal keys and a very simple function F.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary\n",
    "* RSA is generally favored over ElGamal for practical purposes. They both involve modular exponentiation.\n",
    "* Public key systems solve the problem of distributing symmetric keys with one of the authenticating public keys"
