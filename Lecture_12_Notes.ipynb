    "### Password Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic idea is that the user has a secret password and user checks password to authenticate the user.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Hashing the password with a function. When the user enters password, the system computes hash(password) and checks if the user entered correct password.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Unix password system has 25xDES hash function. Salting the password makes it harder to conduct a dictionary attack.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* Salt: a random data that is used as an additional input to password hash function.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Advantage:\n",
    "        * One password hashed 2^12 ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Playback* attack: when an attacker records your packet and sends it back to server. This attack type still works even if the password is encrypted.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "AP4.0 does not protect against server database reading.<br>\n",
    "AP5.0 uses nonce and public key cryptography to mitigate attacks.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Biometrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a person's physical characteristics e.g. fingerprint, voice etc. to authenticate. Usually a combination of biometrics and pin or token or multiple biometrics is used to enhance security.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Token-based Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Smart Card\n",
    "\n",
    "Smart cards have embedded CPU and memory. They come in various forms:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* PIN Protected Cards\n",
    "* Cryptographic challenge/response cards\n",
    "\n",

    "## Authentication in Distributed Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Single Sign-in systems\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Microsoft Passport\n",
    "\n",
    "Allows use of many services with a single account e.g. Outlook, OneNote, Office Online etc.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four parts of the passport:<br>\n",
    "* Passport Unique Identifier (PUID)\n",
    "* User Profile\n",
    "* Credential Information\n",
    "* Wallet\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trusted Intermediaries\n",
    "\n",
    "* Trusted Key Distribution Center (KDC):\n",
    "        \n",
    "        server shares different secret keys with each user\n",
    "        users only know their own symmetric keys to communicate with KDC\n",
    "        users communicate using R1 as session key for shared symmetric encryption.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Trusted Certification Authority (CA):\n",
    "\n",
    "        binds public key to certain entity, E.\n",
    "        digitally signs the public key of E after authentication.\n",
    "        when users want to communicate, they are given the certificate and CA public key\n",
    "        they apply the public key to other user's certificate to get their public key\n",
    "        \n",
    "**Problems**:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* Single point of failure\n",
    "* Single trusted entity by all participants\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "However, these can be solved by breaking intermediaries into multiple domains.<br>"
