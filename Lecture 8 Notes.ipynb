    "* assumed to be transferred over secure means\n",

    "### Secure Socket Layer (SSL)\n",
    "\n",
    "Design goals of SSL include:\n",
    "* Secure transmission at the socket level\n",
    "    * Protocol is built on top of TCP\n",
    "* Peer Authentication\n",
    "* Efficiency\n",
    "* Extendibility\n",
    "    * It should be able to use numerous cipher algorithms\n",
    "* User transparent\n",
    "* Provide data integrity<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**SSL** is a layered protocol, which:\n",
    "1. Takes the message\n",
    "2. Fragments it into manageable blocks (optional compression)\n",
    "3. Applies a MAC (Message Authentication Code)\n",
    "4. Encrypts the message<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**SSL** connects on **port 443** by default.<br>\n",
    "**Session-identifier cache timeout** value is **100 seconds**.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SSL v3.0 Protocol Stack\n",
    "IP << TCP << SSL Record Protocol << SSL Handshake Protocol << SSL Change Cipher Spec << SSL Alert Protocol << HTTP << Telnet<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "*Alert layer*: is where the alert messages are conveyed<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "*Change Cipher Spec*: is used to change the cipher algorithm<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "*Record Layer Protocol*: Header contains three parts; MAC (ensures data integrity), Actual Data and Padding Data (creates pads of data for block ciphers)\n",
    "* Fragments the data\n",
    "* Compresses the fragments, if necessary<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Handshaking Protocol*: Cryptographic parameters such as protocol version, cryptographic algorithms etc. are produced by this protocol.<br>\n",
    "Protocol simply happens as follows:\n",
    "* Client and server exchange hello messages with their cryptographic parameters\n",
    "* Client and server authenticate each other with pre-master secret (also client can send its certificate, if needed)\n",
    "* Server creates master key and sends it to the client\n",
    "* Client decodes the master key and uses it to encode the session<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problems of SSL\n",
    "*People have cracked SSL encryption* and many users still use *SSL 2.0 instead of SSL 3.0*. Also, *firewalls can't regulate the data* and *proxies can't cache the information*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transport Layer Security (TLS)\n",
    "\n",
    "TLS provides transport layer security for web applications. It provides confidentiality and data integrity between two end points. TLS is layered into:\n",
    "* TLS Record Protocol\n",
    "* TLS Handshake Protocol<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages of TLS\n",
    "\n",
    "Web Apps can use it transparently for secure communication.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "*TLS Record Protocol*: layers on top of TCP, *provides data confidentiality* using **symmetric key cryptography**  and also *provides data integrity* using a **message authentication checksum**.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The keys for TLS are uniquely generated for each TLS session.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Operations of the TLS Records Protocol**\n",
    "1. Read messages\n",
    "2. Fragment messages into manageable chunks\n",
    "3. Optional compression\n",
    "4. Calculate a MAC\n",
    "5. Encrypt the send the data\n",
    "\n",
    "At the **receiving end**, the **exact operations are repeated** in **reverse order**.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "*TLS Handshake Protocol*: is layered on top of TLS Record Protocol. It is used to:\n",
    "1. Authenticate the client and the server\n",
    "2. Exchange keys\n",
    "3. Negotiate the encryption and data integrity algorithms (*Change cipher spec*)\n",
